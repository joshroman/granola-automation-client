# SAVE STATUS

Your goal is to put this project into a temporary "saved" state for the developer to return to.

- Run the "context_prime.md" command
- Update the TODO.MD file to reflect current project state and any tasks that are "INPROC"
- Update the PROEJCT_SPECS.MD file to reflect any specification changes
- Update the README to reflect any changes
- If appropriate, run git commands to commit changes and push, if user requests it.
