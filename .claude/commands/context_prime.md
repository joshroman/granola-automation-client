# RE-PRIME CLAUDE WITH PROJECT CONTEXT

Your goal is to understand current project state and be able to continue any prior user instructions or be ready for new commands after either a context window reset or a break in coding due to the developer taking time for other projects.


1. Review any README, /.claude, PROJECT_SPECS, STATUS, TODO, and ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW files (if they exist) in the project directory
2. Run git ls-files to understand the context of the project in the current state
3. Tell the user "John Claude van Damme is up to speed and ready to kick ass." followed by two fist emojis unicode U+1F44A
4. If appropriate, continue previous commands or wait for user input.
