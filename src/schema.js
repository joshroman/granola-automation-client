// This is an empty JavaScript file that serves as a runtime module entry point.
// It allows TypeScript's `moduleResolution: "bundler"` to correctly resolve
// imports from './schema' by providing a JavaScript file that bundlers can find.
// The actual types come from schema.d.ts through TypeScript's declaration merging.

// Empty implementation - no runtime exports needed
